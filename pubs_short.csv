From 'Acton's Pubs and Inns (1989) :

""At the Acton Green end of Acton Lane, the lane takes a sharp right turn and then a left turn round an old field boundary. On the corner of this last turn stands the Swan. Acton Lane is an ancient way and there was a cluster of cottages here in early days. The pub is however first recorded in 1871 when the publican was James Brown who owned the house when it passed to the Phoenix Brewery, Latimer Road. The area around that part of Acton Lane was built up rapidly during that period. The pub passed to the Law Guarantee Trust and in 1909 to Charringtons.

It survived the rebuilding in the area, was renovated and added to ; although the original house can still be seen. It still retains its original garden and some of the trees.""

It is rumoured that the pub survived demolition in the 1970s as part of the building of the Beaconsfield Road Council Estate next door because the then Leader of the Council was a regular there.",Acton Green

The bar has a popular local following as a community hub and is situated roughly half-way between Crystal Palace and Anerley rail/London Overground stations.

Inside, a single small compact room has a wooden top bar and assorted seating with tables, benches and a couple of armchairs. The interior décor is in shades of blue grey, complemented by the wooden flooring and dim lighting from modern hanging lights and chandelier. Keg beers are served from taps that are fixed on a former steam pipe from the brewery. Popular with the younger generation, this is very family and dog friendly. The atmosphere is easy going and relaxed. Be prepared to share a table. The bar has up to two handpumps with at least one cask ale available. The main draw for beer drinkers is the array of craft keg lines (up to eight) which contain a changing variety of local beers from Gipsy Hill and Southey breweries. Wine and local spirits are also available along with low/no alcohol beers and cans from the fridge. Outside, there are a couple of table sets on the pavement, which are put out during opening hours.
