(Both Laine and Punch are ultimately owned by US bank Fortress Investment Group). The L-shaped bar, along much of the inside wall of the large single room, is equipped with ten handpumps, usually offering a range of up to four cask ales and at least one cider, plus fifteen keg beer lines.  Decor is light and airy, whilst seating consists of a mixture of upholstered banquettes and wooden chairs. Outside, the garden has been enhanced with a number of open-sided huts for four, some comfortable wooden tables and chairs with sunshades and a few of the Big Smoke signature biergarten-style long trestle tables with benches.  In winter the area may be protected from the elements with a canvas roof and provided with heaters. An extensive menu includes pub-grub favourites, sharing platters and more up-market dishes.  Normally, breakfast is served from 9am but, under the terms of the licence, alcohol may not be served until 10am and the pub has indicated that alcohol service starts at 11am. There is no food service between 3pm and 5pm. Various food and drink offers may be seen on the venue website, including a "work from the pub" offer.

Walls are decorated, in typical Wetherspoon style, with illustrations of local history. Up to seven changing ales are chosen according to the demand of the pub''s many regulars and usually include at least one dark beer and often several from local breweries.  The standard Wetherspoon food offerings are available until 11pm each evening. Note that under the terms of the premises licence, although open earlier for breakfast, alcoholic drinks may not be sold until 9am.

The sides are of a plastic film which can be removed when the weather allows. On entering you are greeted by a semi-island bar which on one side leads to a rear seated alcove. The main bar retains most of the features it had before the change of name but with new fixtures and fittings, candles on the tables, carpet and so forth. To the right of the bar is a fireplace and log fire. There is a much greater emphasis on food but it is not a requirement that you eat. For those so minded there is a good range of keg beers from the likes of Two Tribes, Kernel, Wild Card and Gipsy Hill. Toilets are upstairs. The downstairs cellar-bar was converted into a small, intimate jazz club with its own stage and bar (no cask beer). Regular events will continue to be held.
