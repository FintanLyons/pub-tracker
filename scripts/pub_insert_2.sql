A planning application to demolish the Cross Lances in Hanworth Road was submitted to Hounslow Council February 2020 (Planning Reference: 01254/236/P5). This application was refused. There were numerous reasons for refusal, the most important being the first: The proposed development would result in the loss of an existing public house without satisfactory re-provision or justification for its loss. The proposed development would therefore be unacceptable in principle and contrary to Intend to Publish London Plan Policy HC7; Hounslow Local Plan Policy CI1 and the intent of the National Planning Policy Framework.

The current name is reputed to be derived from its one-time role as a coal cellar for the Savoy Hotel; or, alternative story, because the pub was the haunt of coal heavers working at the quays below.  The licence was for wines and spirits only until 1948. One of London''s Real Heritage Pubs, M&B Nicholson''s has preserved the original decor, including friezes above the bar and original windows.

Previously a Victorian public house and more recently a Jamie''s Italian restaurant and then chicken and burger concept Coqbull, the site blossomed again as The Devonshire; publican Oisín Rogers, Flat Iron founder Charlie Carroll and Ashley Palmer-Watts, the former Fat Duck executive chef, joined forces to open the new pub and restaurant in November 2023. The ground-floor pub is a “relaxed, top-quality pub honouring the building’s history as an inn since 1793”. Decor is authentic pub-style, burgundy leather banquettes, wood-panels and  gleaming brass. The best seats in the house are three snugs literally behind the bar, but you will have to be invited or ask permission to come across! The owners want the pub to be as democratic as possible: "it doesn''t matter if you are a binman or a chairman, you are welcome". There is home-made bar food including bacon sandwiches, scotch eggs, sausage rolls and cheese and ham hock toasties. Drinks in this free-house of course include cask ale, up to four ales from six handpumps, but there are in addition a large number of keg fonts with a major focus on Guinness. The latter has already been described as "perfect" and in December 2024 news reports stated that the pub sold between four and six thousand pints of Guinness a day. Diageo has said that this site is now "the biggest Guinness account in the world". In August 2024 the pub became the first in the country to sell Guinness 0.0 no-alcohol on draught. The pub has gone viral on social media but if this starts to fade, the owners are confident that their obsession with getting every detail right will carry them forward. As at date of this entry the venue continues to be very popular indeed and hence often crowded. Upstairs, there are three dining rooms with a total 150 covers and a wood-ember grill for steaks and seafood. A three-course set-price menu is on offer at both lunch and dinner featuring the likes of prawn and langoustine cocktail, steak and chips and sticky toffee pudding. The two-page wine list contains a fair selection including many bottles reasonably-priced for the area. A rooftop area is also there for sunny days. The upstairs restaurant does take over 100 walk-ins each day but you need to be patient! In 2025 the pub added three private dining rooms with a separate entrance round the corner in Sherwood Street, the rooms named after Amy Winehouse, John Lennon, and David Bowie.

    (E'1367', E'Harp', E'London', E'47 Chandos Place\n\nLondon\n\nWC2N 4HS', E'The Harp for many years was first tenanted and then owned by the legendary Binnie Walsh, who ran it as a small, friendly, and independent free house with a large selection of well-kept ales and still ciders. Under her leadership it picked up numerous awards including in 2010 the ultimate accolade, CAMRA National Pub of the Year. In 2014 the pub was bought by Fuller''s who upgraded the plumbing and wiring but otherwise left the pub pretty much the same. Fuller''s gave a commitment that it would continue to recognise this iconic pub, particularly amongst ale and cider drinkers. From 2014 the pub has carried on winning various CAMRA and other awards (see 2018 branch Pub of the Year photo with manager Paul Sims and branch chairman the late Les Maggs) including again branch PoTY in 2023 and joint runner-up in the branch PoTY, 2025. The 2025 photo shows manager Paul Sims and branch chair Wanda Piontek. A board in the upstairs lounge now lists its various awards, with plenty of space left! Also see photo of the CAMRA certificates displayed in the ground-floor bar area. The pub is popular with musicians and stage hands from the London Coliseum (when they can squeeze in!), for whom it has a convenient back door. The narrow bar is adorned with mirrors and portraits; there is no intrusive music or TV; and the upstairs room provides a refuge from the busy throng. This pub is deservedly popular as a main cask ale destination venue in central London and can become very crowded, but once you manage to get to the bar you will normally be spotted and served quickly. Drinking is permitted outside. The alleyway (Brydges Place, formerly Taylors Buildings until the 1930s) next door was for years blocked with doors by the pub''s neighbour, the Institute of Chinese Medicine. Through the campaigning efforts of a CAMRA member and a local business man, after more than 10 years Westminster Council reasserted rights to this as a public highway and the doors were removed. The Harp site has been noted by Westminster Council as an unlisted building of merit.

There are Latin inscriptions (with translations) on the wooden beams commemorating this ambush. When he was working in nearby Catherine Street, the novelist Charles Dickens was also a regular here, as was, it is said, Karl Marx.\n\nThe ground floor bar consists of two small dark rooms with down-lighters, low beams, wood panelling and bare floorboards.
