Note the charming explanatory wall plaques on the outside of the pub. This is the original "wet-led pub" as there is no kitchen and no food is served (check with the staff regarding BYO). Normally five ales are available and often including some unusual ones. Now open at the weekend, it is popular with locals, civil servants and those tourists who stumble across it; and it may become crowded at peak times.

It was founded in 1945. Membership, male and female of all ranks, is mainly drawn from present or past members of British and friendly allied Special Forces, the intelligence community, and others whose work reflects the club''s ethos. Members include some current holders of the Victoria and George Cross, and the club''s patron is the Princess Royal. Great stress is placed on the personal qualities of applicants before they are admiitted to membership. Facilities include a dining room and bar, and some accommodation. Various of the clubrooms are named after countries or individuals from them who assisted our WWII effort. The Club is famous for its display of photographs of members of wartime SOE and OSS, and those from the post war era; members killed in action have a black frame to their photograph. Following severe financial problems earlier in this century, the club is now on a firm financial footing and has a strong programme of guest speakers and events.

(One of the old names, Cantons, can be seen being held by one of the gargoyles on the top of the building).\n\nFamous in the 1960s and 70s for folk music and then punk, latterly it has become a jazz venue and home to SpiceJazz club. Up to 5 cask ales from the McMullen range on offer and free admission to the main bar but you may well have to pay for music gigs in the basement, see venue website.

Part of the Hollywood Green leisure complex, that corner of the High Road was called Spouter''s Corner in the past for its popularity for free speech, or "spouting" in a similar style to Speaker''s Corner at Hyde Park. Open air meetings were held until the 1950s and it was also an assembly point for hiring workers. You enter through an outside, covered terrace into a very modern pub which it does quite well. Some striking and large murals and wall art adorn the place together with a large sculpture from a local artist. The area to the back is designated as a dining area but this may only apply during peak times. Plenty of story boards on local history and notable residents such as Ted Willis and Jack Hawkins. Following CAMRA''s updated definition of "real cider", pubs such as this selling for example Old Rosie and Orchard Pig or other ciders such as Thistly Cross, Stans, Gwynt Y Draig, Broadoak etc. no longer qualify for the "Real cider" tag.', 51.5966, -0.108911, E'(020) 8881 3891', E'https://placekitten.com/402/302'),

Situated on the corner with Parkway, the pub has several linked but varying drinking areas, together with outside bench seating. Food is served seven days a week from 12.00 - 22.00 and late afternoons there can often be special deals available. At lunchtimes it attracts the office worker crowd which changes as the day goes on. Back in 1973, there were only around 115 premises recorded as selling real ale in London. Although that number has grown many fold, sadly only three quarters of the original number still exist and are selling cask.

Occupying the ground floor of a modern office block, at corner of Red Lion Square, this is an L-shaped bar drinking area at street level. Contemporary style décor, high re-purposed-wood tables surrounded by seating, and some vibrant artwork; the downstairs cocktail bar has teal, black and dark brown leather booths, with contemporary light fixtures.

Two alleyways provide access from Hampstead Road and Gower Street. Exposed brickwork and low lighting with chesterfield seating make this a pleasant retreat from the nearby tower blocks and busy main roads. Food is served lunchtime and early evening, mostly Italian together with Burgers and Steaks. The bedrock of the pub’s custom is now from the nearby corporate HQs – Debenhams, HMRC, Santander and Facebook. This is a young crowd hence the emphasis on Craft Beers.

A Victorian exterior with tiled side alley, which though hardly sunlit, can be used for outside drinking. Inside, the drinking area is narrow but some 80 feet long, with the bar having an amazing 60 feet of frontage. That said there is live music here every night of the week apart from Sunday & Monday.

It has a fine wooden bar counter and back bar, glazed wooden screens dividing the room and three impressive chandeliers.

We do not know if the live music and events will continue. There is no ref to them on the website. The following description covers how it was .............  it may not still be relevant Another part of the real ale renaissance taking place in this part of London. Although the emphasis is undeniably on food (hams hanging in the food preparation area are visible from the bar), this gastro pub has had up to three cask beers on at any one time. It is also big enough for those who just want a drink to enjoy one without feeling uncomfortable. The whole impression is one of space, helped by a large bar area and high ceilings. There is a large restaurant area to the rear of the pub, and an outdoor drinking/smoking space both to the side and the front. Underground: Archway. Overground: Upper Holloway.

As such it is a visitor magnet and is frequented by (a lot of!) tourists plus civil servants and their political masters. Grade II-listed and one of London''s Real Heritage Pubs, it gives an impression of discreet grandeur. Particularly of note are the high bar-back, etched mirrors and splendid hanging brass lamps. There are two smallish bar areas each with a bank of four handpumps. At busy meal times drinkers-only may be discouraged from occupying the limited number of tables, but there is a side alley for vertcal drinking.

There is plenty of standing room as well and vertical drinking is assisted by unusual peninsular shelf projections and tall bar stools. Three large TV screens are not overly intrusive even for football.  For sun-lovers and smokers, benches with umbrellas are available on the pavements outside.\n\nFairly standard ''traditional'' pub meals are available. There is no function room, but it may be possible to reserve the far end of the room for larger groups.\n\nBeing close to the BBC’s Broadcasting House, in former times this pub was frequented not only by the poet Dylan Thomas, but also by the actress Ellis Powell, who played the title role in the radio series Mrs Dale''s Diary until she was sacked in favour of Jessie Matthews.

Also none available on 17/06/25. The closure of this traditional street-corner pub gave considerable cause for concern that its charms would be lost forever. However, the good news is that the pub has re-opened and the inter-war interior of this former Truman''s pub remains on show as does its fine exterior. The essential component is the use of wooden panelling which incorporates mirrors, beer names and wonderful fire-places. There remain several rooms and a larger side-room for entertainments. There is also a walled garden for warmer and lighter evenings with summer hog roasts and DJs. Pizzas are served from the open kitchen. A traditional piano completes the scene.

This is the latest outlet to be opened by Bloomsbury Leisure Group, hence a sister to the Euston and Waterloo Taps. The Stranded is close to Charing Cross mainline station, at the eastern end of the splendid West Strand building, the very large triangular site split in two on its Strand frontage by the imposing, but relatively modern, glass entrance doors to Coutts Bank. The pub has an entrance on the Strand and another (step-free) one round the corner on William IV Street. There is a 13-metre Czech-built bar with four ale handpumps at the right hand end of the bar as you look at it, these being against the rear wall and not on the bar itself.  Whilst an Adnams brew may often be found, it is beers from northern English breweries that tend to predominate, often including something (but not Landlord) from Timothy Taylor. The current ale list is on the venue website. Prices are relatively inexpensive for the West End of London. The T-bar of five rotating keg beers is adjacent, often including some from smaller brewers. But, the main feature of the bar - towards its left hand end - are the Czech Budvar pilsner dispenses with Original, Nefiltr (unfiltered), Dark, 0.0% and more. These are served in two-thirds measures in larger tankards, to accommodate a good head, and three different pours are available: Hladinka (a full pour with a generous layer of silky foam on top), Šnyt (a smaller pour with more foam) and Mlíko (a mug of wet, sweet foam favoured in Czech pubs). Specialised glass washing/cooling is alongside.

When owners Steve Barnes and Will Williams (under whom it had been North London CAMRA Pub of the Year four times) announced their intention to retire, a massive campaign by local people and CAMRA supported by Hackney Council led to the pub being eventually saved.

The pub was rebuilt in 1913 and is now one of a small number of central pubs still equipped with a Commons division bell. It''s a frequent hang out for lobbyists, policy wonks, even the odd politician being treated (shurely shome mishtake?). But apart from the suits, it has been described as "there’s some magic in the air too, as if a whiff of Soho found its way to SW1". Note the beautiful illustrated signwork above the ground-floor bar. Intimate drinking booths lending themselves to conspiracy and plotting if not heinous political manoeuvrings run along two sides of the downstairs stone flagged Storey''s Wine Bar that serves bar food. Children may eat in the upstairs restaurant that also serves as function room. Reasonably unobtrusive TV screens in all bars. Apparently those of a nervous disposition should be aware that the pub is haunted by the ghost of a small boy who died in a fire many years ago. Refurbished March 2025 at a cost of over £1m.

The pub occupies most of the top level of "Victoria Island" overlooking the station concourse on both sides, the interior featuring blue and cream tiling and two curved bars with marble style tops, and banquette seating on the opposite wall. The large hexagonal lampshades and snugs introduce design characteristics reminiscent of the 1920s and 1930s.  Twenty-first century screens show times of train departures. Access is via escalators on the west side or stairs on the south and east sides of the island.

M&B/Nicholsons taking over as operators from June 2025 following refurbishment. This is yet another pub said to have been frequented by Dylan Thomas, George Orwell, and the wartime Fitzrovian crowd, many of whom were in, or desperate for, jobs at the nearby BBC. Part of the attraction for them was the stronger and hard-to-find Younger''s Scotch Ale here. Dylan Thomas is said to have met his wife Caitlin Macnamara in this pub; they got married at the third attempt having twice spent the licence fee on booze. It was a marriage made in heaven - both were adulterous and drunken but she was physically violent towards him as well. The dilettante Julian Maclaren-Ross was also a regular in the thirties and forties, often with his trademark silver-knobbed cane and teddy-bear overcoat.  Court-martialled in 1943, he features as X.Trapnell in Anthony Powell''s Dance to the Music of Time series of books. Yet another regular was the bohemian Welsh artist Nina Hamnett, whose fondness for boozing in Fitzrovia''s pubs eventually led to a sad and penurious alcoholic decline accompanied by one-night stands with any of the lower end of the clientele willing to buy her a drink.

The central peninsular servery, complete with snob screens at one end, is surrounded by its five original compartments, each with its own entrance from the street, divided by wood and glass partitions, these punctured by low service doors for "pot boys" to slip through to collect drinking pots and glasses. The ornate back bar draws the eye up to the highly decorated ceiling and these, together with the intricate carving on the partitions, impart a rococo feel to the place.  Light is provided by the magnificent full-height engraved bow windows. The passageway and bar area to the side sport some delightful wall tiling and floor mosaics as well as a fireplace in which, in colder weather, a real fire burns.  Beyond is the open kitchen and separate Dining Room. The full menu offered here is served in all areas of the pub itself, where sandwiches are also available between noon and 4pm on weekdays only. The food offering includes Sunday roasts but the pub is often packed with locals at Sunday lunchtime so be warned! Unobtrusive screens offer sports TV which, this being Maida Vale, is often rugby or tennis.

The very special nature of this venue was recognised in 2022 when its listing was raised to Grade II*.

    (E'1844', E'Warrington Hotel', E'Maida Vale', E'93 Warrington Crescent\n\nMaida Vale\n\nW9 1EH', E'Flanked by K2 red telephone kiosks also listed Grade II, this is one of the most opulent of London pubs. This spacious, stucco-fronted hotel was put up in the middle of the 19th century. It was given a major update later in the century, probably in the 1890s, and the glorious tiled columns to the entrance porch and a huge mosaic floor bearing the name of the pub give some idea of the richness that lies on the other side of the doors. It is also beautifully carpeted throughout. The main room is on the right and has a grey marble-topped counter with unusual, bulgy pilasters and lozenge decoration. Grey marble also appears in the columns of a three-bay arcade which marches across the right-hand side of the room, embracing the generously scaled staircase to what is now the upstairs restaurant. Some of the windows have lively stained glass, while over the servery is a semi-circular canopy, decorated with Art Nouveau-style paintings of naked ladies. More such paintings, with the signature Colin Beswick 1965, appear on the back wall and are meant to evoke the unlikely story that has grown up that this was once a brothel. The left-hand room was once clearly divided into three as the patterning in the ceiling shows. The lowest status part has matchboard wall panelling and an ornate, much decayed mirror advertising Bass pale ale. Other things to note are the attractive and unusual high-level chequerwork glazed screens, the skylight over the first-floor landing and the deep, decorative cornices on the first floor. The extensive food menu includes Sunday roasts, and veggie and vegan dishes. Note that the hotel and bar are for adults, and it is reported that children are not welcome.

Inside are three drinking areas and a secluded side room with marble fireplace; in the main bar area there''s a warming living fire in the grate. There are four cask ale handpumps, selling at reasonable prices by London standards.  The house cask beer is appositely and amusingly named "Made of Ale"!

Originally it was called the ''Horse and Groom'' and served as a posting house on the London to Guildford stagecoach route. The public house was rebuilt further back from the road, in a mock Georgian style. An interesting piece of local history is The Petersham lockup, a white-boarded, slate roofed building beside the arch which now leads into the new Forge Lane houses. It gives a glimpse of village life in the late 18th century. Situated in the carpark of the Fox and Duck public house, the lockup was erected in 1787. The Lock-up is Grade 2 listed and in 2004 thanks to the representations made by the Environment Trust for Richmond, the lock-up appeared on the English Heritage list of important buildings at risk (the BAR register).\n\nCoffee & pastries:  Monday to Friday from 8am.

The imposing mock Tudor building, complete with tall chimneys and lattice windows, was built in 1935 and is Grade II listed. Built originally as a public house and hotel with a ballroom attached, it has undergone several refurbishments over the years: The most significant being in 1996, when two sides of the pub consisting of the saloon bar and restaurant were merged into one. It has, however, managed to retain its wood panelling, fireplaces, brickwork and other original features. Since then, it has been further refurbished with a modern twist to cater for its clientele. The main entrance leads to the L-shaped tiled bar with its wooden top and brick backdrop. The ornate glazed brick fireplaces are now occupied by coal effect fires, whilst the ornate chandeliers have contemporary lighting, complementing the pale blue ceiling and wooden panelling. The flooring is part carpet in a cream and grey pattern and part tiled. There is an assortment of seating with both high and low tables. The raised area to the right of the bar gives a more traditional atmosphere, complete with banquette seating under the watchful eye of William Willett in an imposing photograph. The left of the bar leads into the dining area, on a raised level with double aspect windows. A further assortment of seating is geared up for viewing major sporting events shown on a couple of large TV screens. Framed prints, some on a time zone theme, play a low key reference to the pub''s heritage. The former ballroom is now the Function Room, and with its ornate arched ceiling and window drapes is now used for community events and hosting live music (this is available for hire). The outside seating area around the pub overlooks the square and is sectioned off with flower troughs. The patio garden is overlooked by trees and has a couple of shelters. There are a couple of cask ales plus a cider on handpump (Weston''s) along with a range of keg beers, including Camden Town, Beavertown and BrewDog. This pub is named in honour of local MP, William Willett, who campaigned for daylight saving in the 1900s and which subsequently led to the Summer Time Act 1916 and the creation of British Summer Time.

In October 2020 Greene King announced that 79 of their pubs would remain closed and that it was likely that some of them would not re-open. It looked as if the Old Dairy might be one of those. The website was dead and emails sent to them have bounced. It had been closed and boarded since lockdown. Oddly enough the building was just that - Friern Manor Dairy Farm, established 1839, this building dates from 1889. With its crenelated exterior, minarets and large relief etchings extolling the virtues of the various processes in producing milk, it certainly presents an unusual sight. It''s received an impressive make-over and, with such a large space to work with, can successfully offer separate dining arrears without impinging upon the overall pub feel. It has the now standard mix of large tables and sofas, illuminated by table lamps plus candles and with huge picture windows either end.

There are lots of different areas to eat or drink - details of food and serving times are best obtained for their website. With 5 pumps and an ever-changing range what''s on can change daily.

The attractive bas reliefs of various stages of milk and butter production on the exterior brick walls have been restored and internally the dairy theme has been ''milked'' for all its worth with old butter churns, milk adverts and a mock-up of a cow being milked above the main bar area. The premises were originally owned by the Friern Manor Dairy Farm established in 1836. A small corner bar has been created in what was probably the dairy shop, retaining white tiled walls and ceiling.
