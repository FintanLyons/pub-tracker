Today it is a cosy pub restaurant with several different rooms with low ceilings and an Inglenook fireplace.  It is very convenient for Junction 4 of the M25, and parking is available.  The menu varies to include seasonal specialities and an emphasis on fish dishes. Outside restaurant hours (see food times), light bites are available from the bar Monday to Saturday 3pm to 6pm. Note that last orders are 30 minutes before closing. Unfortunately, in July 2022, the R7 bus route which used to pass close to the pub was re-routed and no longer does so.   So there is no convenient access by public transport any more.   The alternatives are a walk of about 1200 metres from the centre of Chelsfield or a longer walk of about 1700 metres from Knockholt station, which is in zone 6.

However, there is an extensive range of up to ten draught keg beers (eg. Anspach & Hobday, Cloudwater, Drop Project, Gipsy Hill, Inkspot, Kernel, Lost and Grounded, Orbit, Vault City and Villages). These can change but cover a range of beer styles from lager, porter, fruited sour and IPA. Drinks can be served from the bar to the table, especially at busy periods.

The large enclosed patio garden is accessed to the right of the bar and is mostly covered with a huge awning with many table sets and benches plus other seating. This is heated during the winter months. Overlooked by tall trees, this offers plenty of shade during the summer months. A range of well tended plants are along one wall. Popular during the warmer weather, this can get busy, especially at weekends when the outside bar is open offering three keg beers.

However, research suggests that this bar is not very ancient and was installed some time after 1911 by the then licensee who mistakenly thought his pub layout contravened the Licensing Consolidation Act of 1910 and hurriedly created the tiny snug. The likes of Dylan Thomas, Ernest Hemingway and Alec Guinness have enjoyed a pint or two of excellent beer here; fortunately for them they were all drinking after 7th January 1928 when the bars were waist-high in water. Now, we hope, the Thames Barrier will stop another inundation! The rear conservatory has a fruit bearing vine and leads to a terrace overlooking the Thames. Well worth a visit but often crowded in summer. If you are lucky you can climb up the spiral stairs to the tiny mezzanine terrace which has two or three tables.

The proposed development would therefore be unacceptable in principle and contrary to Intend to Publish London Plan Policy HC7; Hounslow Local Plan Policy CI1 and the intent of the National Planning Policy Framework.

Diageo has said that this site is now "the biggest Guinness account in the world". In August 2024 the pub became the first in the country to sell Guinness 0.0 no-alcohol on draught. The pub has gone viral on social media but if this starts to fade, the owners are confident that their obsession with getting every detail right will carry them forward. As at date of this entry the venue continues to be very popular indeed and hence often crowded. Upstairs, there are three dining rooms with a total 150 covers and a wood-ember grill for steaks and seafood. A three-course set-price menu is on offer at both lunch and dinner featuring the likes of prawn and langoustine cocktail, steak and chips and sticky toffee pudding. The two-page wine list contains a fair selection including many bottles reasonably-priced for the area. A rooftop area is also there for sunny days. The upstairs restaurant does take over 100 walk-ins each day but you need to be patient! In 2025 the pub added three private dining rooms with a separate entrance round the corner in Sherwood Street, the rooms named after Amy Winehouse, John Lennon, and David Bowie. Kitchen hours start at noon, with last sitting 10pm or 9pm on Sundays. NB the pub management requests no laptop usage or loud phone calls whilst in the pub.

A KPS Pub Co spokesman said: “We hope to inject some passion and integrity into the pub scene based on our appreciation of good-quality, independently made alcohol. The focus of the pub will be on artisan beer and spirits, with the aim of making craft beer accessible for all.” Chris Bickle, director in the licensed leisure team at Savills, added: “The locality is home to several award-winning dining pubs and the arrival of The Foxglove as a carefully curated wet-led pub will complement the area well.” As it had been......

A marvellous multi-roomed pub at the top of some steep steps leading from Heath St., there is a less steep incline if you approach from the tube via Holly Mount. A sensitive refurbishment some years ago opened up the rooms at the back and there is an upstairs dining room.

The guest beer range is ever changing, in Sept 2024 we came across beers from Thornbridge, Moor, Three Acre and Attic Brew. On the catering front we have been informed the hours are now noon to 9pm daily but always best to call and check before you visit especially if you plan to go later in the evening. Operated by the team behind the The Sussex Arms in Twickenham and The Express Tavern in Kew, The Magdala is an independent pub with 20 keg beers and 7 cask ales. The original 1885 pub, named after Lord Napier of Magdala, was rebuilt by Charrington''s in the inter-war period. The interior is welcoming, clean and bright, with bar stools, wooden tables and chairs in both rooms. There is a small outdoor area with a few seats. Excellent Sunday roasts. Dog friendly pub. Sold by Punch in the summer of 2014 to an offshore property developer, its future became threatened. Local activists succeeded in getting it listed as an Asset of Community Value. It re-opened briefly in summer 2015 but soon closed again. Early 2021 saw a careful restoration of the wooden panelling throughout the ground floor bar and dining areas, with new sections of wood blending with the original paneling in the bar area at the back of the pub (where the toilets used to be). The green stained glass has been replicated in the dining area, letting in lots of natural light. The function room on the first floor has not been reopened to date, but hopefully in future it will be available to the local community as an important meeting place.

John Creed became landlord in 1762 and initiated the name British Museum Tavern, to identify the pub with the nearby collection, which was being developed from specimens collected by Sir Hans Sloane. William Finch Hill designed the 1855 redevelopment with the ground floor front and classic mahogany back bar fitting being evident today. 1889 saw another redesign of the interior by architects Wylson and Long. Finch''s classical style was partly preserved as five separate bars were created, with partitions and decorations of stained glass. Two rare examples of these stained glass windows survive in the bar today, an essential part of any visit. Five bars were reduced to three in 1935 becoming one in the 1960s.

Previous real ciders - Hogan''s: Warwickshire, Little Pomona: Herefordshire, Sandford: Devon and Snailsbank: Herefordshire. Reopened at the beginning of October 2023. Food: similar to Southampton Arms - ie pies; scotch eggs, sausage rolls and salt beef sandwiches. 10 keg lines, up to 4 cider lines and up to 6 changing cask beers from independent UK breweries inc a stout or a mild such as Left Handed Giant. Its similarity is no coincidence as operator Nick Bailey was previously the manager at the Southampton. It wishes to be also known as an Ale & Cider House, wonder where that came from?

Formerly known as the League of Seven Stars after the seven provinces of the Netherlands; amongst its first customers were Dutch sailors who had settled in the area. Shakespeare performances took place nearby in Middle Temple and the playwright himself may even have drunk here. Later on, the novelist Charles Dickens is thought to have used the pub as a model for The Magpie & Stump featured in Pickwick Papers. Nowadays the bar, with its decorative Victorian bar-back, is located in the narrow central space between two other distinctive drinking areas. There are several impressive brewery mirrors and others advertising various drinks. The pub is popular with the legal profession and the snug drinking area on the left is known as the Wig Box. The pub is run by the redoubtable Roxy Beaujolais - the Alewife For the Ages, as a pub critic has called her. The very well regarded food is a result of her management. The pub''s own website contains much greater details on the pub''s history and Roxy''s. The interior features classic film posters and caricatures with a legal theme. Its beer range includes guest beers from smaller brewers. The comforting gastro-fare menu changes daily and will satisfy meat-eaters and vegetarians alike. Note that toilets are only accessible via steep stairs, a relic of the old Elizabethan house the inn once was. Another feature of the pub is the resident pub cat. Tom Paine resided at the pub until 2012. There is a picture of him on the wall and a poem dedicated to him. He was followed by ''Ray Brown'' then ''Peabody''.

There are known to have been at least three different buildings on this site, the current one dating back to 1896. It was originally a coaching inn and the New River passed through its grounds. Londoners would often visit the pub on a day out to enjoy the fishing, cricket and tea grounds. It was comprehensively restored in 2004. Main bar is light and airy, with several doors which are opened in warm weather. It won a number of Community Pub Awards as well as being a finalist in the North London Pub of the Year competitions in 2009, 2010 and 2011 although it is under new ownership since those awards were won.

Furnishings are a mix of leather sofas and old style wooden chairs; there is a wooden floor throughout on two levels and candle lighting predominates. The cask beers available seem to change regularly and we have seen beers from various breweries across the country but they also favour tap takeovers - for example on a visit in November 2023 there were three beers from the Renegade Brewey. The pub also offers draught Leffe and Hoegaarden. Food is served, either in the pub or the upstairs restaurant, check website for latest times.

When owners Steve Barnes and Will Williams (under whom it had been North London CAMRA Pub of the Year four times) announced their intention to retire, a massive campaign by local people and CAMRA supported by Hackney Council led to the pub being eventually saved.

The pub was rebuilt in 1913 and is now one of a small number of central pubs still equipped with a Commons division bell. It''s a frequent hang out for lobbyists, policy wonks, even the odd politician being treated (shurely shome mishtake?).

The pub occupies most of the top level of "Victoria Island" overlooking the station concourse on both sides, the interior featuring blue and cream tiling and two curved bars with marble style tops, and banquette seating on the opposite wall.

M&B/Nicholsons taking over as operators from June 2025 following refurbishment. This is yet another pub said to have been frequented by Dylan Thomas, George Orwell, and the wartime Fitzrovian crowd, many of whom were in, or desperate for, jobs at the nearby BBC. Part of the attraction for them was the stronger and hard-to-find Younger''s Scotch Ale here. Dylan Thomas is said to have met his wife Caitlin Macnamara in this pub; they got married at the third attempt having twice spent the licence fee on booze. It was a marriage made in heaven - both were adulterous and drunken but she was physically violent towards him as well. The dilettante Julian Maclaren-Ross was also a regular in the thirties and forties, often with his trademark silver-knobbed cane and teddy-bear overcoat.  Court-martialled in 1943, he features as X.Trapnell in Anthony Powell''s Dance to the Music of Time series of books. Yet another regular was the bohemian Welsh artist Nina Hamnett, whose fondness for boozing in Fitzrovia''s pubs eventually led to a sad and penurious alcoholic decline accompanied by one-night stands with any of the lower end of the clientele willing to buy her a drink. For those interested in more of this pub''s literary and artistic history, a fascinating download is on the pub website.

Inda, a small operator running a number of pubs around London, has a good record in upgrading local pubs. The pub, dating from 1826 and Grade II listed, underwent a significant makeover prior to reopening, opening up the ground floor room to more natural light from the large windows at the front and from the conservatory down a few steps to the rear.  The bar counter front, of heavily carved wood, contrasts with a modern open chrome metal shelving back-bar.  The room retains its wooden panelling, fireplace and polished wooden floor and is now furnished with rugs and an eclectic mixture of dining tables and chairs. Upstairs is a delightful function room in which the refurbishment has exposed some very old wallpaper, original sash window shutters and another fireplace.  The ambience of the room has been enhanced by the hanging of some wonderful paintings on the walls. The two handpumps may offer a choice of Allsopp''s ales (this is a new "brand" owned by a descendant of the Allsopp family who has revived the beers) and sometimes Fuller''s London Pride.

    (E'Prince Alfred', E'Maida Vale', E'5A Formosa Street\n\nMaida Vale\n\nW9 1EE', E'A spectacular Victorian pub built in 1856 and refitted around 1896 with an extraordinary set of fittings, now very rare survivors from the days when so many London pubs had small drinkers'' compartments surrounding the servery (those at the Princess Louise, Holborn, marvellous as they are, are a twenty-first century reinstatement). The central peninsular servery, complete with snob screens at one end, is surrounded by its five original compartments, each with its own entrance from the street, divided by wood and glass partitions, these punctured by low service doors for "pot boys" to slip through to collect drinking pots and glasses. The ornate back bar draws the eye up to the highly decorated ceiling and these, together with the intricate carving on the partitions, impart a rococo feel to the place.  Light is provided by the magnificent full-height engraved bow windows. The passageway and bar area to the side sport some delightful wall tiling and floor mosaics as well as a fireplace in which, in colder weather, a real fire burns.  Beyond is the open kitchen and separate Dining Room. The full menu offered here is served in all areas of the pub itself, where sandwiches are also available between noon and 4pm on weekdays only. The food offering includes Sunday roasts but the pub is often packed with locals at Sunday lunchtime so be warned! Unobtrusive screens offer sports TV which, this being Maida Vale, is often rugby or tennis. Artist and illustrator Edward Ardizzone drew "The Saloon Bar at the Prince Alfred" and his illustration is in Maurice Gorham''s famous book "Back to the Local". The very special nature of this venue was recognised in 2022 when its listing was raised to Grade II*. NB for those needing to use the WCs here: the rambling layout of the pub and the need to duck under partitions can be confusing, and depending on where you are in the pub it may be easier to exit the pub, walk in a clockwise direction round it, and enter again when you see the dining room; the stairs to the WCs are adjacent.', 51.5244, -0.18499, E'(020) 7286 3287', E'https://placekitten.com/401/301'),

This spacious, stucco-fronted hotel was put up in the middle of the 19th century. It was given a major update later in the century, probably in the 1890s, and the glorious tiled columns to the entrance porch and a huge mosaic floor bearing the name of the pub give some idea of the richness that lies on the other side of the doors. It is also beautifully carpeted throughout. The main room is on the right and has a grey marble-topped counter with unusual, bulgy pilasters and lozenge decoration. Grey marble also appears in the columns of a three-bay arcade which marches across the right-hand side of the room, embracing the generously scaled staircase to what is now the upstairs restaurant. Some of the windows have lively stained glass, while over the servery is a semi-circular canopy, decorated with Art Nouveau-style paintings of naked ladies. More such paintings, with the signature Colin Beswick 1965, appear on the back wall and are meant to evoke the unlikely story that has grown up that this was once a brothel. The left-hand room was once clearly divided into three as the patterning in the ceiling shows. The lowest status part has matchboard wall panelling and an ornate, much decayed mirror advertising Bass pale ale. Other things to note are the attractive and unusual high-level chequerwork glazed screens, the skylight over the first-floor landing and the deep, decorative cornices on the first floor. The extensive food menu includes Sunday roasts, and veggie and vegan dishes. Note that the hotel and bar are for adults, and it is reported that children are not welcome.

In October 2020 Greene King announced that 79 of their pubs would remain closed and that it was likely that some of them would not re-open. It looked as if the Old Dairy might be one of those. The website was dead and emails sent to them have bounced. It had been closed and boarded since lockdown. Oddly enough the building was just that - Friern Manor Dairy Farm, established 1839, this building dates from 1889. With its crenelated exterior, minarets and large relief etchings extolling the virtues of the various processes in producing milk, it certainly presents an unusual sight. It''s received an impressive make-over and, with such a large space to work with, can successfully offer separate dining arrears without impinging upon the overall pub feel. It has the now standard mix of large tables and sofas, illuminated by table lamps plus candles and with huge picture windows either end. The atmosphere is added to by impressive chandeliers, exposed brick walls and duct work with steel girders. There are lots of different areas to eat or drink - details of food and serving times are best obtained for their website. With 5 pumps and an ever-changing range what''s on can change daily.

The attractive bas reliefs of various stages of milk and butter production on the exterior brick walls have been restored and internally the dairy theme has been ''milked'' for all its worth with old butter churns, milk adverts and a mock-up of a cow being milked above the main bar area. The premises were originally owned by the Friern Manor Dairy Farm established in 1836. A small corner bar has been created in what was probably the dairy shop, retaining white tiled walls and ceiling. The main bar has a high ceiling, stone flagged floor, exposed ventilation, a large ''milking time’ clock and mock gas lighting.
