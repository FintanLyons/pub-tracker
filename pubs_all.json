The popular menu concentrates on traditional British fare with both snacks and mains as well as popular Sunday roasts. The pub was originally built in the Victorian era for the Nalder & Collyer Brewery of Croydon in conjunction with the coming of the railway to Bromley North. The green and ochre tiling completely covers the two external facades of this essentially triangular footprint building. Located at the junction of East Street and North Street, this formed part of the regeneration of East Street with the large \"BROMLEY NORTH\" sign standing on the other side of the street. Handy for the Bromley Little Theatre, just around the corner as well as Bromley North station opposite and adjacent bus station.

Inside, the friendly and chatty atmosphere is welcoming with attentive bar staff. The main entrance leads via a vestibule into the bar area with multi-levelled areas leading off to the left and an alcove with seating to the right. The interior décor of dark wood panelling with green walls and white ceiling is offset with various framed prints. The large windows with their arched framework bring in plenty of light.

The two original bars were restored to their original appearance; an olive tree-filled conservatory (with a retractable roof for summer) was added at the rear; and, on the second floor, a secluded, wood-panelled private dining room that seats up to 22 was created.\n\nOnce inside, you could be excused for thinking that you were in a rural setting instead of just a few yards from the busy Fulham Road and close to Chelsea football ground!  You enter a small lobby with an off-sales hatch to the servery and doors to the former public bar, to the left, and the larger saloon bar on the right.  The interior is a typical modest pub-fitting from between the wars, now quite rare, albeit more comfortably furnished for the twenty-first century. Owner James Blunt has been quoted as saying \"The pub is my favourite place in the world. It brings strangers together in a world where politicans want to separate us...\" The pub offers three cask ales which change from time to time; a small range of keg and bottled beers and ciders; and a well-selected wine list and the inevitable cocktails.  Whilst the pub still firmly caters for drinkers, for those who wish to eat the pub’s dining experience claims to champion British produce and to be founded on seasonal, sustainable and locally sourced ingredients, all under the care of a Gordon Ramsay-trained head chef.  Whilst the kitchen has a break in the late afternoon (except on Sundays), bar snacks are available all day and include classics such as scotch eggs alongside more original dishes like buttermilk-fried guineafowl. Note that the pub is in a gated private road which contrives with the double-yellow lines on the adjacent public highway to make parking nearby very difficult. If you choose to get here via West Brompton station, there is an interesting \"rural route\" south through the Victorian-era Brompton cemetery (which closes an hour or so before dusk).","area":"Chelsea"},{"id":"313","name":"Hollywood Arms","lat":51.486,"lon":-0.18415,"address":"45 Hollywood Road\n\nChelsea\n\nSW10 9HX","phone":"(020) 7349 7840","features":[],"photoUrl":"https://placekitten.com/403/303","description":"Up-market side street local built in 1865 (1856 notice on pub’s front is wrong) probably by the Godwins according to Pevsner, although the local council gives the builders as Corbett & McClymont.

It was welcomed in 1880 by the local journal, the Bedford Park Gazette, which expressed the hope that it would stop the sale of alcoholic liquors through other channels to the estate workmen building the new houses. The pub is Grade II*-listed and has now been registered with Hounslow Council as an Asset of Community Value, Hounslow ACV 001 and renewed 014. Notable interior features include tiling by William de Morgan and Walter Crane, and Arts & Crafts mirrors and pictures. The swing sign is based on the original painted by TM Rooke in 1880 and, amazingly, during refurbishment in 2016, the long-lost original sign was found again. It has now been expertly conserved, gifted to the Bedford Park Society by Greene King, and is on display in the upper parish hall room of St. Michael's church opposite the pub. There are four distinct drinking areas (two bars, a dining area and a 'snug'), and ten hand pumps serve a cider (usually Westons Old Rosie) and regularly changing guest ales, sourced both nationally and locally. (If it is a hot spell the number of ciders may temporarily increase.) There is also a good range of unusual bottled beers, and keg craft beers such as Beavertown and Camden. Two-pint takeaway cartons are available. A comprehensive selection of board games are available.

The wood panelling of the interior, which keeps part at least of the dividing screen between the large front room and the more snug rear (which includes a fairly cosy gas-effect fire and inglenook), wood bar and back bar, all make for an inviting stop when in Crouch End, or a short diversion off your walk. There's a good mixture of hanging decoration, and art on the walls, and a friendly enthusiastic staff team happily served us drinks at the bar counter - four cask ales on including well-kept Fuller's London Pride and Timthy Taylor's Landlord. The food is by Roshan’s Kitchen. As well as traditional English fayre, there is also Sri Lankan curries and Jamaican Roasts. Their website contains a very interesting section on the pub's history going back to 1937, it is worth mentioning the Toby plaque in the downside wall.

There are no regular cask ales, but a changing range of guests mainly from London microbreweries. Of the four handpumps present, only two are used (with a third optionally reserved for a cider). However, there is an extensive range of up to ten draught keg beers (eg. Anspach & Hobday, Cloudwater, Drop Project, Gipsy Hill, Inkspot, Kernel, Lost and Grounded, Orbit, Vault City and Villages). These can change but cover a range of beer styles from lager, porter, fruited sour and IPA. Drinks can be served from the bar to the table, especially at busy periods. This is also popular for dining with award winning food (Harden's 2023 and 2024) from a contemporary menu with dishes cooked from fresh using seasonal ingredients. Service is friendly and welcoming.

For those so minded there is a good range of keg beers from the likes of Two Tribes, Kernel, Wild Card and Gipsy Hill. Toilets are upstairs.

History: A traditional Ex Fuller’s 19th century pub with a distinctive tiled frontage and original etched glass windows. Situated on the corner of Cross Lances Road and Hanworth Road. A planning application to demolish the Cross Lances in Hanworth Road was submitted to Hounslow Council February 2020 (Planning Reference: 01254/236/P5). This application was refused. There were numerous reasons for refusal, the most important being the first: The proposed development would result in the loss of an existing public house without satisfactory re-provision or justification for its loss. The proposed development would therefore be unacceptable in principle and contrary to Intend to Publish London Plan Policy HC7; Hounslow Local Plan Policy CI1 and the intent of the National Planning Policy Framework. A glance through the history books shows the first mention of the pub was in 1819 - when the \"Signe of the Cross Lances\" was erected on the Hanworth Road.

It is named in homage to the original Blue Stoops in Burton-upon-Trent, where Allsopp's brewed from 1730. Allsopp's recommenced brewing in 2020 using the original Allsopp’s yeasts from the National Collection of Yeast Cultures in Norwich; the original Allsopp’s IPA now has pride of place on the pub’s bar. Allsopp's has also commissioned the manufacture of beer engines with high “swan necks”, allowing the pumping by hand of ale from the cellar up to customers, in a theatrical manner. Four handpumps dispense three ales from Allsopp’s plus one reserved for a guest ale. Ale prices are reported as reasonable for the area. Also note the various brewery memorabilia and the marvellous Allsopp's mirror on the wall. The Blue Stoops has been recognised by CAMRA as one of their Outstanding Conversions and Restorations. The pub has also revived Double Diamond keg at 3.8% ABV, again with various wall references including Peter Probyn's famous cartoon adverts of the Double Diamond Little Man. The DD produced by Jamie Allsopp is brewed with pale malt and two American hops, Citra and Mosaic. It is vegan, and gluten-free; and now has its own website at doublediamondbeer.com A menu of seasonal English food is available including a short bar-food menu. Note that if in the bar, you can order from the restaurant menu; but not vice-versa! And also note that on Sundays, only the Sunday menu is offered in both the front bar and back dining room. The pub has also recently announced a collaboration with Blandy's, the Madeira winemaker. The pub has garnered very good reviews since it opened and The Times restaurant critic said after his visit \"the headline on the Blue Stoops for me is that it is very good and not very expensive...it is a brilliant little pub trying out great new things\". A well-known beer writer has also commented about the gastropub-good food \"rarely found in the same place as perfectly-conditioned cask ale\".

Much was salvaged from the wreckage of the old pub, including tiles, reusable bricks and the original bar and fireplaces, and some of the decorative ceilings were also rescued.\n\nThe opportunity was taken to redesign the internal layout by moving the kitchen to the basement, which had previously been used as changing rooms for a local hockey team. The inside is quite roomy, stretching around the bar to a dining room at the back. Outside is a garden/patio area also used for dining in summer. The new pub showcases the best brewers and distillers in London, alongside a fresh, seasonal menu in the new dining room. The ale offerings include a house bitter.

It is London's most central pub, being just 50 metres from the King Charles I statue from which all distances from the capital are measured, and it has a great view over Trafalgar Square. Following a serious fire in the pub's basement in July 2022, the pub reopened in April 2023. And to celebrate that reopening, London Fire Brigade Deputy Assistant Commissioner Greg Ashman, and fire fighters from Soho fire station came to help Fuller’s Chief Executive Simon Emeny cut the ceremonial ribbon. DAC Ashman was in charge of the incident in July, when over 100 members of the London Fire Brigade worked to put the flames out. The venue is now one of Fullers' first all-electric pubs, in a move towards carbon-neutrality and reduction of fire risk. The pub is furnished with traditional tables, chairs and plush banquette-type seating on the ground and upper floors, the mezzanine area being used mainly for dining.  The large Gundeck bar downstairs has semi-private booths, based on the lower gundeck of the Victory, as well as some more informal seating. The ground-floor bar generally offers a choice of six cask ales, mainly from Fuller's and varying according to the season, alongside a range of craft beer taps; the cask ale choice downstairs will be more limited. The pub can become very busy at peak eating times and non-diners are requested not to occupy the tables intended for those eating. For those taking breakfast (when offered by the pub), note that alcohol may not be served until 10am. Starting in 2024, on Trafalgar Day in October every year the pubs hosts a spectacular Trafalgar gala dinner; this is also a charity fund-raiser and in 2024 raised money for the Royal Navy and Royal Marines Charity.

The classic wooden panelling and leather covered seats all convey an almost timeless quality even in the lee of Centre Point and the new 'legoland' of Renzo Piano's brightly coloured Central St Giles. The public bar has chess tables, darts and theatre posters. The main bar has tall windows and drapes, an ornate ceiling with chandeliers, an unusual fireplace and a mixture of leather clad chairs and stools, and there's a range of theatre posters and and other attractions on the walls. An attractive tiled passageway at the side (a former carriage entrance) is used for outdoor drinking in summer (we believed this closed around 5.15pm after complaints from locals but in May 2025 we were informed by a visitor \"that it opens later these days. Needs checking\") and leads to the small cosy saloon bar at the rear. Upstairs there are two lounges to relax in, with one providing wonderful views on to St Giles High Street, Legoland, and passing buses and traffic, often grid-locked. A tavern has stood on this site since the 16th century, when it catered for condemned men on their way to execution (a claim made by various local pubs!). An eclectic mix of musicians from nearby Denmark Street (London's tin-pan alley), students, bell ringers from St Giles-in-the-Fields, and crazy art students paying in coppers - all make for a clientele that you wouldn't want to miss!","area":"London"},{"id":"1102","name":"Angel","lat":51.5247,"lon":-0.0873832,"address":"73 City Road\n\nLondon\n\nEC1Y 1BD","phone":"(020) 7253 3753","features":[],"photoUrl":"https://placekitten.com/402/302","description":"A delightful one-bar pub which will send your food and drinks up to you to the upstairs restaurant that doubles as a function room.

Previously a Victorian public house and more recently a Jamie's Italian restaurant and then chicken and burger concept Coqbull, the site blossomed again as The Devonshire; publican Oisín Rogers, Flat Iron founder Charlie Carroll and Ashley Palmer-Watts, the former Fat Duck executive chef, joined forces to open the new pub and restaurant in November 2023. The ground-floor pub is a “relaxed, top-quality pub honouring the building’s history as an inn since 1793”. Decor is authentic pub-style, burgundy leather banquettes, wood-panels and  gleaming brass. The best seats in the house are three snugs literally behind the bar, but you will have to be invited or ask permission to come across! The owners want the pub to be as democratic as possible: \"it doesn't matter if you are a binman or a chairman, you are welcome\". There is home-made bar food including bacon sandwiches, scotch eggs, sausage rolls and cheese and ham hock toasties. Drinks in this free-house of course include cask ale, up to four ales from six handpumps, but there are in addition a large number of keg fonts with a major focus on Guinness. The latter has already been described as \"perfect\" and in December 2024 news reports stated that the pub sold between four and six thousand pints of Guinness a day. Diageo has said that this site is now \"the biggest Guinness account in the world\". In August 2024 the pub became the first in the country to sell Guinness 0.0 no-alcohol on draught. The pub has gone viral on social media but if this starts to fade, the owners are confident that their obsession with getting every detail right will carry them forward. As at date of this entry the venue continues to be very popular indeed and hence often crowded. Upstairs, there are three dining rooms with a total 150 covers and a wood-ember grill for steaks and seafood. A three-course set-price menu is on offer at both lunch and dinner featuring the likes of prawn and langoustine cocktail, steak and chips and sticky toffee pudding. The two-page wine list contains a fair selection including many bottles reasonably-priced for the area. A rooftop area is also there for sunny days. The upstairs restaurant does take over 100 walk-ins each day but you need to be patient! In 2025 the pub added three private dining rooms with a separate entrance round the corner in Sherwood Street, the rooms named after Amy Winehouse, John Lennon, and David Bowie.

Under her leadership it picked up numerous awards including in 2010 the ultimate accolade, CAMRA National Pub of the Year. In 2014 the pub was bought by Fuller's who upgraded the plumbing and wiring but otherwise left the pub pretty much the same. Fuller's gave a commitment that it would continue to recognise this iconic pub, particularly amongst ale and cider drinkers. From 2014 the pub has carried on winning various CAMRA and other awards (see 2018 branch Pub of the Year photo with manager Paul Sims and branch chairman the late Les Maggs) including again branch PoTY in 2023 and joint runner-up in the branch PoTY, 2025. The 2025 photo shows manager Paul Sims and branch chair Wanda Piontek. A board in the upstairs lounge now lists its various awards, with plenty of space left! Also see photo of the CAMRA certificates displayed in the ground-floor bar area. The pub is popular with musicians and stage hands from the London Coliseum (when they can squeeze in!), for whom it has a convenient back door. The narrow bar is adorned with mirrors and portraits; there is no intrusive music or TV; and the upstairs room provides a refuge from the busy throng. This pub is deservedly popular as a main cask ale destination venue in central London and can become very crowded, but once you manage to get to the bar you will normally be spotted and served quickly. Drinking is permitted outside. The alleyway (Brydges Place, formerly Taylors Buildings until the 1930s) next door was for years blocked with doors by the pub's neighbour, the Institute of Chinese Medicine. Through the campaigning efforts of a CAMRA member and a local business man, after more than 10 years Westminster Council reasserted rights to this as a public highway and the doors were removed. The Harp site has been noted by Westminster Council as an unlisted building of merit.

But, unlike many other pubs in the area, because it is slightly hidden away, it is not quite so touristy.  The Grade II listed Lamb and Flag is to be found down Lazenby Court (an alley) from Floral Street or up Rose Street from Garrick Street.\n\nLeased by Fuller's since October 2011, and fully owned since 2013, the pub underwent a sympathetic renovation before re-opening.  Though no longer a free house (and thus the cask ale selection is predominantly from the Fuller's stable), it remains an attractive and pleasant traditional pub without music, muzak or games machines.\n\nThe upstairs bar and restaurant, where the main food service is available (but, please note, food and drink is table service only upstairs) is named the Dryden Room, after the poet John Dryden, whose satirical writing made him many enemies as a result of which he was brutally beaten by hired thugs in the alley outside the pub in 1679.  There are Latin inscriptions (with translations) on the wooden beams commemorating this ambush. When he was working in nearby Catherine Street, the novelist Charles Dickens was also a regular here, as was, it is said, Karl Marx.\n\nThe ground floor bar consists of two small dark rooms with down-lighters, low beams, wood panelling and bare floorboards.  The back room has a fireplace and plain wooden seats.\n\nBrass plaques dotted around the bar commemorate where regulars of the past always stood, and the tradition is still kept up now.","area":"London"},{"id":"1432","name":"Lamb & Flag","lat":51.515,"lon":-0.150512,"address":"24 James Street\n\nLondon\n\nW1U 1EL","phone":"(020) 7408 0132","features":[],"photoUrl":"https://placekitten.com/402/302","description":"A corner pub first licensed in 1777 but rebuilt in 1895, its red granite exterior displays a gold and etched glass fascia below the projecting cornice, Windsor lanterns and a name board proclaiming allegiance to the former Simonds brewery.

The current ale list is on the venue website. Prices are relatively inexpensive for the West End of London. The T-bar of five rotating keg beers is adjacent, often including some from smaller brewers. But, the main feature of the bar - towards its left hand end - are the Czech Budvar pilsner dispenses with Original, Nefiltr (unfiltered), Dark, 0.0% and more. These are served in two-thirds measures in larger tankards, to accommodate a good head, and three different pours are available: Hladinka (a full pour with a generous layer of silky foam on top), Šnyt (a smaller pour with more foam) and Mlíko (a mug of wet, sweet foam favoured in Czech pubs). Specialised glass washing/cooling is alongside.

M&B/Nicholsons taking over as operators from June 2025 following refurbishment. This is yet another pub said to have been frequented by Dylan Thomas, George Orwell, and the wartime Fitzrovian crowd, many of whom were in, or desperate for, jobs at the nearby BBC. Part of the attraction for them was the stronger and hard-to-find Younger's Scotch Ale here. Dylan Thomas is said to have met his wife Caitlin Macnamara in this pub; they got married at the third attempt having twice spent the licence fee on booze. It was a marriage made in heaven - both were adulterous and drunken but she was physically violent towards him as well. The dilettante Julian Maclaren-Ross was also a regular in the thirties and forties, often with his trademark silver-knobbed cane and teddy-bear overcoat.  Court-martialled in 1943, he features as X.Trapnell in Anthony Powell's Dance to the Music of Time series of books. Yet another regular was the bohemian Welsh artist Nina Hamnett, whose fondness for boozing in Fitzrovia's pubs eventually led to a sad and penurious alcoholic decline accompanied by one-night stands with any of the lower end of the clientele willing to buy her a drink.

The central peninsular servery, complete with snob screens at one end, is surrounded by its five original compartments, each with its own entrance from the street, divided by wood and glass partitions, these punctured by low service doors for \"pot boys\" to slip through to collect drinking pots and glasses. The ornate back bar draws the eye up to the highly decorated ceiling and these, together with the intricate carving on the partitions, impart a rococo feel to the place.  Light is provided by the magnificent full-height engraved bow windows. The passageway and bar area to the side sport some delightful wall tiling and floor mosaics as well as a fireplace in which, in colder weather, a real fire burns.  Beyond is the open kitchen and separate Dining Room. The full menu offered here is served in all areas of the pub itself, where sandwiches are also available between noon and 4pm on weekdays only. The food offering includes Sunday roasts but the pub is often packed with locals at Sunday lunchtime so be warned! Unobtrusive screens offer sports TV which, this being Maida Vale, is often rugby or tennis. Artist and illustrator Edward Ardizzone drew \"The Saloon Bar at the Prince Alfred\" and his illustration is in Maurice Gorham's famous book \"Back to the Local\". The very special nature of this venue was recognised in 2022 when its listing was raised to Grade II*. NB for those needing to use the WCs here: the rambling layout of the pub and the need to duck under partitions can be confusing, and depending on where you are in the pub it may be easier to exit the pub, walk in a clockwise direction round it, and enter again when you see the dining room; the stairs to the WCs are adjacent.","area":"Maida Vale"},{"id":"1842","name":"Real Drinks","lat":51.5246,"lon":-0.18456,"address":"4 Formosa Street\n\nMaida Vale\n\nW9 1EE","phone":"(020) 7286 2244","features":[],"photoUrl":"https://placekitten.com/402/302","description":"Opened in August 2017, this was the first sister establishment of the award-winning ‘liquid delicatessen’ Realale.com, founded in 2005 in East Twickenham.

This spacious, stucco-fronted hotel was put up in the middle of the 19th century. It was given a major update later in the century, probably in the 1890s, and the glorious tiled columns to the entrance porch and a huge mosaic floor bearing the name of the pub give some idea of the richness that lies on the other side of the doors. It is also beautifully carpeted throughout. The main room is on the right and has a grey marble-topped counter with unusual, bulgy pilasters and lozenge decoration. Grey marble also appears in the columns of a three-bay arcade which marches across the right-hand side of the room, embracing the generously scaled staircase to what is now the upstairs restaurant. Some of the windows have lively stained glass, while over the servery is a semi-circular canopy, decorated with Art Nouveau-style paintings of naked ladies. More such paintings, with the signature Colin Beswick 1965, appear on the back wall and are meant to evoke the unlikely story that has grown up that this was once a brothel. The left-hand room was once clearly divided into three as the patterning in the ceiling shows. The lowest status part has matchboard wall panelling and an ornate, much decayed mirror advertising Bass pale ale. Other things to note are the attractive and unusual high-level chequerwork glazed screens, the skylight over the first-floor landing and the deep, decorative cornices on the first floor. The extensive food menu includes Sunday roasts, and veggie and vegan dishes. Note that the hotel and bar are for adults, and it is reported that children are not welcome.

The large quantity of pump clips adorning the walls shows the sheer range of beers served over the past few years. Up to five cask ales are available, which often include a stout or porter. A couple of keg beers are also available, which change on a regular basis. A changing range of real ciders and perries are always available, as are a small range of local canned and bottled real and gluten-free beers. Prices are extremely competitive. The club has regular live music, runs beer festivals twice per year, and frequently has \"Meet the Brewer\" evenings as well as organising excursions. The club also benefits from a large rear garden. The function room is regularly used by several local groups and can be reserved for private events. Bar sessions may be extended for events and at the discretion of the staff. The club is also open on Saturday evenings when an event is scheduled (see website or social media links for further details).

Originally it was called the 'Horse and Groom' and served as a posting house on the London to Guildford stagecoach route. The public house was rebuilt further back from the road, in a mock Georgian style. An interesting piece of local history is The Petersham lockup, a white-boarded, slate roofed building beside the arch which now leads into the new Forge Lane houses. It gives a glimpse of village life in the late 18th century. Situated in the carpark of the Fox and Duck public house, the lockup was erected in 1787. The Lock-up is Grade 2 listed and in 2004 thanks to the representations made by the Environment Trust for Richmond, the lock-up appeared on the English Heritage list of important buildings at risk (the BAR register).\n\nCoffee & pastries:  Monday to Friday from 8am.

Geared up for dining as well as partying, this venue can get busy, especially at the weekends. Over 21s only. The imposing mock Tudor building, complete with tall chimneys and lattice windows, was built in 1935 and is Grade II listed. Built originally as a public house and hotel with a ballroom attached, it has undergone several refurbishments over the years: The most significant being in 1996, when two sides of the pub consisting of the saloon bar and restaurant were merged into one. It has, however, managed to retain its wood panelling, fireplaces, brickwork and other original features. Since then, it has been further refurbished with a modern twist to cater for its clientele. The main entrance leads to the L-shaped tiled bar with its wooden top and brick backdrop. The ornate glazed brick fireplaces are now occupied by coal effect fires, whilst the ornate chandeliers have contemporary lighting, complementing the pale blue ceiling and wooden panelling. The flooring is part carpet in a cream and grey pattern and part tiled. There is an assortment of seating with both high and low tables. The raised area to the right of the bar gives a more traditional atmosphere, complete with banquette seating under the watchful eye of William Willett in an imposing photograph. The left of the bar leads into the dining area, on a raised level with double aspect windows. A further assortment of seating is geared up for viewing major sporting events shown on a couple of large TV screens. Framed prints, some on a time zone theme, play a low key reference to the pub's heritage. The former ballroom is now the Function Room, and with its ornate arched ceiling and window drapes is now used for community events and hosting live music (this is available for hire). The outside seating area around the pub overlooks the square and is sectioned off with flower troughs. The patio garden is overlooked by trees and has a couple of shelters. There are a couple of cask ales plus a cider on handpump (Weston's) along with a range of keg beers, including Camden Town, Beavertown and BrewDog. This pub is named in honour of local MP, William Willett, who campaigned for daylight saving in the 1900s and which subsequently led to the Summer Time Act 1916 and the creation of British Summer Time. The pub name is unique within Great Britain. Listed on the National Heritage List for England - please refer to: https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1427230 The Grade II listing was given in 2015 in order to protect this example of an interwar public house, with its plasterwork and structured timber framing.

Their website mentions 5 cask beers but a visit to the pub in June 2023 revealed 4. In October 2020 Greene King announced that 79 of their pubs would remain closed and that it was likely that some of them would not re-open. It looked as if the Old Dairy might be one of those. The website was dead and emails sent to them have bounced. It had been closed and boarded since lockdown. Oddly enough the building was just that - Friern Manor Dairy Farm, established 1839, this building dates from 1889. With its crenelated exterior, minarets and large relief etchings extolling the virtues of the various processes in producing milk, it certainly presents an unusual sight. It's received an impressive make-over and, with such a large space to work with, can successfully offer separate dining arrears without impinging upon the overall pub feel. It has the now standard mix of large tables and sofas, illuminated by table lamps plus candles and with huge picture windows either end. The atmosphere is added to by impressive chandeliers, exposed brick walls and duct work with steel girders. There are lots of different areas to eat or drink - details of food and serving times are best obtained for their website. With 5 pumps and an ever-changing range what's on can change daily. Original Description:- Another new Regent Inns Free House opened earlier in 1997 in former shop and workshop premises, originally a dairy. The attractive bas reliefs of various stages of milk and butter production on the exterior brick walls have been restored and internally the dairy theme has been 'milked' for all its worth with old butter churns, milk adverts and a mock-up of a cow being milked above the main bar area. The premises were originally owned by the Friern Manor Dairy Farm established in 1836. A small corner bar has been created in what was probably the dairy shop, retaining white tiled walls and ceiling. The main bar has a high ceiling, stone flagged floor, exposed ventilation, a large 'milking time’ clock and mock gas lighting. An eating area at the rear is adorned with prize cow pictures.","area":"Stroud Green"},{"id":"2214","name":"White Lion","lat":51.5694,"lon":-0.11265,"address":"125-127 Stroud Green Road\n\nStroud Green\n\nN4 3PX","phone":"(020) 7561 8880","features":[],"photoUrl":"https://placekitten.com/404/304","description":"There are two handpumps which greet you on entering but in Feb 2023 only the one in use and when that beer ran out it did not look as if it would be changed immediately that evening.
